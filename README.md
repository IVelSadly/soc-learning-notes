# SOC Learning Notes

This repository contains study notes and practical labs focused on
**Security Operations Center (SOC)** and **Blue Team fundamentals**.

The goal of this project is to document my learning process in defensive
security, including monitoring concepts, threat detection basics,
system analysis and simple automation used to support security operations.

All content is for educational purposes and reflects my progression
as a cybersecurity student focused on defensive security.
