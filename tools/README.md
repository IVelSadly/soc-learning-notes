# Security Tools (Learning Purpose)

This folder contains small scripts and tools created for learning
and practicing cybersecurity fundamentals from a defensive
security (SOC / Blue Team) perspective.

The tools here are intentionally simple and focused on understanding
concepts such as log analysis, event identification and basic automation.

They are not intended to replace professional security solutions,
but to support learning, experimentation and documentation of
security-related reasoning.
