# 🛠️ Labs (Practical Security Exercises)

This folder contains a set of **practical labs and incident investigations** focused on hands-on troubleshooting,
system analysis, and defensive security techniques relevant to Security Operations Center (SOC) and Blue Team roles.

Each lab documents:
- the **context and environment**
- the **problem or exercise scenario**
- the **investigation steps**
- the **root cause or conclusion**
- **lessons learned** tied to real-world defensive security

These labs go beyond theory and show how I apply technical reasoning and problem-solving skills in real scenarios.

## 📂 Labs Included

### 🔹 **Linux System Basics**
A practical exercise from academic work where Linux system
information and monitoring commands were used to understand
resource reporting and system state.

**Location:** `linux-system-basics/`

---

### 🔹 **Incident Troubleshooting – Swing Music on UmbrelOS**
A real troubleshooting case where a music streaming application
failed playback after an update. This lab demonstrates:
- Docker container inspection
- volume bind mount analysis
- debugging streaming failures
- root cause diagnosis and mitigation

**Location:** `incident-troubleshooting-umbrel-swingmusic/`

## 📌 How to Use These Labs

Each lab directory includes:
- A **README.md** explaining the exercise
- Supporting documentation and commands
- Screenshots or evidence where relevant
- (Sometimes) scripts or configuration examples

These labs can help demonstrate skills in:
- system inspection and monitoring
- container and filesystem debugging
- structured incident analysis
- problem decomposition and reporting

## 🎯 Purpose and Relevance

These labs are not just demonstrations of commands —
they show how I think through problems and document findings
in a way that mirrors **professional SOC/Blue Team workflows**.

They are especially relevant for:
- entry-level SOC analyst roles
- defensive security internships
- operational troubleshooting
- environments using Linux and Docker

## 🚀 Building with This Portfolio

As I continue learning and practicing:
- new labs will be added
- old ones may be improved
- reflections and techniques will be expanded

My aim is to build a body of work that shows real, applicable
security reasoning, not just theory.

Feel free to explore, review and question any of the labs.
