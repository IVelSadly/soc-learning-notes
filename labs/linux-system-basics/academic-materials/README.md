# Academic Reference Material

This folder contains the original academic material used as a reference
for the practical lab documented in this repository.

The content here represents the original assignment provided by the university
and the submission format required for academic evaluation.

All technical analysis, security considerations and learning outcomes
derived from this material are documented separately in the main lab files,
following a security and SOC-oriented perspective.
